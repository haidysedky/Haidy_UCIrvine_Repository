I&#39;m beyond stunned at the workmanship and perfection I&#39;m looking at... I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more words when my eyeballs are back in their sockets and my jaw is back off the floor... but right now - I&#39;m just truly stunned. Really - my brain is frozen in this moment. Thank you doesn&#39;t begin to cover the feelings I have right now. It was the absolute perfect headpiece for me and for the simple dress I have. Thank you a thousand times. Truly impressive. Rivals the $77,000 diamond Tiara I was coveting! Your new BFF - forever... Linda&quot;\\n\\n&quot;This is the most amazing piece of collectable, heirloom pieces I have ever seen. The quality is exquisite and the Swarovski stones really do sparkle like diamonds. Not only is ELB (Eden Luxe Bridal) the most customer-service focused shop I&#39;ve had the pleasure of working with on Etsy, the beautiful tiaras are second to none. Don&#39;t trust the imitations you may see on here; ELB designs are copyrighted...and buying the ORIGINAL is worth every penny! &lt;3&quot;\\n\\n&quot;I am IN LOVE with this tiara! It&#39;s perfect in every way! I spent about 4 months searching online & at bridal shows for the perfect tiara & couldn&#39;t find one for the life of me! I was hoping to find something that combined my three primary inspirations: the bridals looks of Duchess Kate, Princess Madeleine of Sweden, & Lady Mary from Downton Abbey. The craftsmanship is GORGEOUS! Absolutely excellent quality! Heather is a total sweetheart too and is very easy to work with and bounce ideas off of.
